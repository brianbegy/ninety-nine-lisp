# What is it?

[99 Lisp Problems](https://www.ic.unicamp.br/~meidanis/courses/mc336/2006s2/funcional/L-99_Ninety-Nine_Lisp_Problems.html) implemented in clojure.

# But why?

This repo is me trying to knock some of the rust off after having not written clojure for 2 years.

# This isn't very professionally organized, is it?

No. I'm doing all the work in master, I'm not documenting stuff, and I'm just doing the tests I need to to verify my solutions. Them's the breaks with personal weekend projects.
